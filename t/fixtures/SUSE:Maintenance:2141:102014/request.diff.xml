+This update for sles12sp1-docker-image fixes the following issues:
+
+glibc fixed the following security issues:
+
+- CVE-2015-7547: A stack-based buffer overflow in getaddrinfo allowed remote attackers to cause a crash or execute arbitrary code via crafted and timed DNS responses (bsc#961721)
+- CVE-2015-8777: Insufficient checking of LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable allowed local attackers to bypass the pointer guarding protection of the dynamic loader on set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs (bsc#950944)
+- CVE-2015-8776: Out-of-range time values passed to the strftime function may cause it to crash, leading to a denial of service, or potentially disclosure information (bsc#962736)
+- CVE-2015-8778: Integer overflow in hcreate and hcreate_r could have caused an out-of-bound memory access. leading to application crashes or, potentially, arbitrary code execution (bsc#962737)
+- CVE-2014-9761: A stack overflow (unbounded alloca) could have caused applications which process long strings with the nan function to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (bsc#962738)
+- CVE-2015-8779: A stack overflow (unbounded alloca) in the catopen function could have caused applications which pass long strings to the catopen function to crash or, potentially execute arbitrary code. (bsc#962739)
+
+glibc received the following non-security bugfixes:
+
+- bsc#955647: Resource leak in resolver
+- bsc#956716: Don't do lock elision on an error checking mutex
+- bsc#958315: Reinitialize dl_load_write_lock on fork
+
+openssl fixed the following security issues:
+- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046):
+  OpenSSL was vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to
+  decryption of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and
+  EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
+
+  This update changes the openssl library to:
+
+  * Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
+
+    This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
+    "OPENSSL_ALLOW_SSL2" or by using SSL_CTX_clear_options using the
+    SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 flag.
+
+    Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
+    protocol 2 by default previously.
+
+  * Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled
+    if required by old legacy software using the environment variable
+    "OPENSSL_ALLOW_EXPORT".
+
+- CVE-2016-0702 aka the "CacheBleed" attack. (bsc#968050)
+  Various changes in the modular exponentation code were added that
+  make sure that it is not possible to recover RSA secret keys by
+  analyzing cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.
+
+  Note that this was only exploitable if the malicious code was running
+  on the same hyper threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim
+  thread performing decryptions.
+
+- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047):
+  A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser code was fixed that could
+  be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service attack.
+
+- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048):
+  The BN_hex2bn() and BN_dec2bn() functions had a bug that could result
+  in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer leading to crashes.
+  This could have security consequences if these functions were ever
+  called by user applications with large untrusted hex/decimal data. Also,
+  internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL uses data from config files
+  or application command line arguments. If user developed applications
+  generated config file data based on untrusted data, then this could
+  have had security consequences as well.
+
+- CVE-2016-0798 (bnc#968265)
+  The SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user() had a memory
+  leak that attackers could abuse to facility DoS attacks. To mitigate
+  the issue, the seed handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user() was disabled
+
+
+- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374)
+  On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr() and doapr_outch()
+  functions could miscalculate the length of a string and attempt to
+  access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems could have
+  enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to
+  the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions in
+  this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
+  these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1
+  data. Therefore applications that print this data could have been
+  vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line
+  applications could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1
+  data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl
+  is not considered directly vulnerable.
+
+- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415):
+  The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled ciphers.
+
+
+Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs
+that were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
+
+- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of
+  OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored
+  to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
+  "DROWN" attack much easier.
+- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2"
+  This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th
+  2015 at which time the code was refactored to address vulnerability
+  CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.
+
+openssl received the following non-security bugfixes:
+- Avoid running OPENSSL_config twice. This avoids breaking
+  engine loading. (bsc#952871)
+- Ensure that OpenSSL doesn't fall back to the default digest
+  algorithm (SHA1) in case a non-FIPS algorithm was negotiated while
+  running in FIPS mode. Instead, OpenSSL will refuse the digest.
+  (bnc#958501)
+&lt;/description&gt;
+  &lt;summary&gt;Security update for sles12sp1-docker-image&lt;/summary&gt;

+
+- bsc#955647: Resource leak in resolver

+- bsc#958315: Reinitialize dl_load_write_lock on fork
+
+openssl fixed the following security issues:
+- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046):
+  OpenSSL was vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to
+  decryption of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and
+  EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
+
+  This update changes the openssl library to:
+
+  * Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
+
+    This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
+    "OPENSSL_ALLOW_SSL2" or by using SSL_CTX_clear_options using the
+    SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 flag.
+
+    Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
+    protocol 2 by default previously.
+
+  * Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled
+    if required by old legacy software using the environment variable
+    "OPENSSL_ALLOW_EXPORT".
+
+- CVE-2016-0702 aka the "CacheBleed" attack. (bsc#968050)
+  Various changes in the modular exponentation code were added that
+  make sure that it is not possible to recover RSA secret keys by
+  analyzing cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.
+
+  Note that this was only exploitable if the malicious code was running
+  on the same hyper threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim
+  thread performing decryptions.
+
+- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047):
+  A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser code was fixed that could
+  be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service attack.
+
+- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048):
+  The BN_hex2bn() and BN_dec2bn() functions had a bug that could result
+  in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer leading to crashes.
+  This could have security consequences if these functions were ever
+  called by user applications with large untrusted hex/decimal data. Also,
+  internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL uses data from config files
+  or application command line arguments. If user developed applications
+  generated config file data based on untrusted data, then this could
+  have had security consequences as well.
+
+- CVE-2016-0798 (bnc#968265)
+  The SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user() had a memory
+  leak that attackers could abuse to facility DoS attacks. To mitigate
+  the issue, the seed handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user() was disabled
+
+
+- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374)
+  On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr() and doapr_outch()
+  functions could miscalculate the length of a string and attempt to
+  access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems could have
+  enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to
+  the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions in
+  this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
+  these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1
+  data. Therefore applications that print this data could have been
+  vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line
+  applications could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1
+  data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl
+  is not considered directly vulnerable.
+
+- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415):
+  The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled ciphers.
+
+
+Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs
+that were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
+
+- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of
+  OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored
+  to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
+  "DROWN" attack much easier.
+- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2"
+  This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th
+  2015 at which time the code was refactored to address vulnerability
+  CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.
+
+openssl received the following non-security bugfixes:
+- Avoid running OPENSSL_config twice. This avoids breaking
+  engine loading. (bsc#952871)
+- Ensure that OpenSSL doesn't fall back to the default digest
+  algorithm (SHA1) in case a non-FIPS algorithm was negotiated while
+  running in FIPS mode. Instead, OpenSSL will refuse the digest.
+  (bnc#958501)
+&lt;/description&gt;
