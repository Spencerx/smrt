This update for sles12sp1-docker-image fixes the following issues:

glibc fixed the following security issues:

- CVE-2015-7547: A stack-based buffer overflow in getaddrinfo allowed remote attackers to cause a crash or execute arbitrary code via crafted and timed DNS responses (bsc#961721)
- CVE-2015-8777: Insufficient checking of LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable allowed local attackers to bypass the pointer guarding protection of the dynamic loader on set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs (bsc#950944)
- CVE-2015-8776: Out-of-range time values passed to the strftime function may cause it to crash, leading to a denial of service, or potentially disclosure information (bsc#962736)
- CVE-2015-8778: Integer overflow in hcreate and hcreate_r could have caused an out-of-bound memory access. leading to application crashes or, potentially, arbitrary code execution (bsc#962737)
- CVE-2014-9761: A stack overflow (unbounded alloca) could have caused applications which process long strings with the nan function to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (bsc#962738)
- CVE-2015-8779: A stack overflow (unbounded alloca) in the catopen function could have caused applications which pass long strings to the catopen function to crash or, potentially execute arbitrary code. (bsc#962739)

glibc received the following non-security bugfixes:

- bsc#955647: Resource leak in resolver
- bsc#956716: Don't do lock elision on an error checking mutex
- bsc#958315: Reinitialize dl_load_write_lock on fork

openssl fixed the following security issues:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046):
  OpenSSL was vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to
  decryption of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and
  EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.

  This update changes the openssl library to:

  * Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.

    This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
    "OPENSSL_ALLOW_SSL2" or by using SSL_CTX_clear_options using the
    SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 flag.

    Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
    protocol 2 by default previously.

  * Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled
    if required by old legacy software using the environment variable
    "OPENSSL_ALLOW_EXPORT".

- CVE-2016-0702 aka the "CacheBleed" attack. (bsc#968050)
  Various changes in the modular exponentation code were added that
  make sure that it is not possible to recover RSA secret keys by
  analyzing cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.

  Note that this was only exploitable if the malicious code was running
  on the same hyper threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim
  thread performing decryptions.

- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047):
  A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser code was fixed that could
  be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service attack.

- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048):
  The BN_hex2bn() and BN_dec2bn() functions had a bug that could result
  in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer leading to crashes.
  This could have security consequences if these functions were ever
  called by user applications with large untrusted hex/decimal data. Also,
  internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL uses data from config files
  or application command line arguments. If user developed applications
  generated config file data based on untrusted data, then this could
  have had security consequences as well.

- CVE-2016-0798 (bnc#968265)
  The SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user() had a memory
  leak that attackers could abuse to facility DoS attacks. To mitigate
  the issue, the seed handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user() was disabled


- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374)
  On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr() and doapr_outch()
  functions could miscalculate the length of a string and attempt to
  access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems could have
  enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to
  the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions in
  this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
  these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1
  data. Therefore applications that print this data could have been
  vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line
  applications could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1
  data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl
  is not considered directly vulnerable.

- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415):
  The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled ciphers.


Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs
that were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:

- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of
  OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored
  to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
  "DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2"
  This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th
  2015 at which time the code was refactored to address vulnerability
  CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.

openssl received the following non-security bugfixes:
- Avoid running OPENSSL_config twice. This avoids breaking
  engine loading. (bsc#952871)
- Ensure that OpenSSL doesn't fall back to the default digest
  algorithm (SHA1) in case a non-FIPS algorithm was negotiated while
  running in FIPS mode. Instead, OpenSSL will refuse the digest.
  (bnc#958501)
