- CVE-2016-0723: Race condition in the tty_ioctl function in drivers/tty/tty_io.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) by making a TIOCGETD ioctl call during processing of a TIOCSETD ioctl call (bnc#961500).
- CVE-2013-7446: Use-after-free vulnerability in net/unix/af_unix.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to bypass intended AF_UNIX socket permissions or cause a denial of service (panic) via crafted epoll_ctl calls (bnc#955654).
- CVE-2015-8767: net/sctp/sm_sideeffect.c in the Linux kernel did not properly manage the relationship between a lock and a socket, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via a crafted sctp_accept call (bnc#961509).

- CVE-2015-3339: Race condition in the prepare_binprm function in fs/exec.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to gain privileges by executing a setuid program at a time instant when a chown to root is in progress, and the ownership is changed but the setuid bit is not yet stripped (bnc#928130).

The following non-security bugs were fixed:
- Fix handling of re-write-before-commit for mmapped NFS pages (bsc#964201).
- Fix lpfc_send_rscn_event allocation size claims bnc#935757
- Fix ntpd clock synchronization in Xen PV domains (bnc#816446).
- Fix vmalloc_fault oops during lazy MMU updates (bsc#948562).
- Make sure XPRT_CONNECTING gets cleared when needed (bsc#946309).
- SCSI: bfa: Fix to handle firmware tskim abort request response (bsc#972510).
- USB: usbip: fix potential out-of-bounds write (bnc#975945).
- af_unix: Guard against other == sk in unix_dgram_sendmsg (bsc#973570).
- dm-snap: avoid deadock on s->lock when a read is split (bsc#939826).
- mm/hugetlb: check for pte NULL pointer in __page_check_address() (bsc#977847).
- nf_conntrack: fix bsc#758540 kabi fix (bsc#946117).
- privcmd: allow preempting long running user-mode originating hypercalls (bnc#861093).
- s390/cio: collect format 1 channel-path description data (bsc#966460, bsc#966662).
- s390/cio: ensure consistent measurement state (bsc#966460, bsc#966662).
- s390/cio: fix measurement characteristics memleak (bsc#966460, bsc#966662).
- s390/cio: update measurement characteristics (bsc#966460, bsc#966662).
- xfs: Fix lost direct IO write in the last block (bsc#949744).
