  <summary>Security update for libvirt</summary>
  <description>libvirt was updated to fix one security issue and several non-security issues.

This security issue was fixed:

- CVE-2015-0236: libvirt allowed remote authenticated users to obtain the VNC
  password by using the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE flag with a crafted (1) snapshot
  to the virDomainSnapshotGetXMLDesc interface or (2) image to the
  virDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc interface. (bsc#914693)
- CVE-2015-5313: path traversal vulnerability allowed libvirtd process to write arbitrary files into file system using root permissions (bsc#953110)

Theses non-security issues were fixed:

- bsc#948686: Use PAUSED state for domains that are starting up.
- bsc#903757: Provide nodeGetSecurityModel implementation in libxl.
- bsc#938228: Set disk type to BLOCK when driver is not tap or file.
- bsc#948516: Fix profile_status to distinguish between errors and unconfined domains.
- bsc#936524: Fix error starting lxc containers with direct interfaces.
- bsc#921555: Fixed apparmor generated profile for PCI hostdevs.
- bsc#899334: Include additional upstream fixes for systemd TerminateMachine.
- bsc#921586: Fix security driver default settings in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf.
- bsc#921355: Fixed a number of QEMU apparmor abstraction problems.
- bsc#911737: Additional fix for the case where security labels aren't automatically set.
- bsc#914297: Allow setting the URL of an SMT server to use in place of SCC.
