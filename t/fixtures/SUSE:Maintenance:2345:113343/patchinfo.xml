This update for SystemD provides fixes and enhancements.

The following security issue has been fixed:

- Don't allow read access to journal files to users. (bsc#972612, CVE-2014-9770, CVE-2015-8842)

The following non-security issues have been fixed:

- Incorrect permissions set after boot on journal files. (bsc#973848)
- Exclude device-mapper from block device ownership event locking. (bsc#972727)
- Explicitly set mode for /run/log.
- Don't apply sgid and executable bit to journal files, only the directories they are contained in.
- Add ability to mask access mode by pre-existing access mode on files/directories.
- No need to pass --all if inactive is explicitly requested in list-units. (bsc#967122)
- Fix automount option and don't start associated mount unit at boot. (bsc#970423)
- Support more than just power-gpio-key. (fate#318444, bsc#970860)
- Add standard gpio power button support. (fate#318444, bsc#970860)
- Downgrade warnings about wanted unit which are not found. (bsc#960158)
- Shorten hostname before checking for trailing dot. (bsc#965897)
- Remove WorkingDirectory parameter from emergency, rescue and console-shell.service. (bsc#959886)
- Don't ship boot.udev and systemd-journald.init anymore.
- Revert "log: honour the kernel's quiet cmdline argument". (bsc#963230)
